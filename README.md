This project uses the Laravel 10 and Vue JS 3 framework and is designed to manage real estate listings: CRUD functions for a listing, listing images, creating/accepting offers for those listings, 
and notifications regarding offers. This application also demostrates Laravel's model policies and scopes functionality, Eloquent ORM, authentication, and Laravel's Dusk Browser testing framework.

 .env.example configuration file and update the MAILER section with your custom settings to confirm your email upon registration.
